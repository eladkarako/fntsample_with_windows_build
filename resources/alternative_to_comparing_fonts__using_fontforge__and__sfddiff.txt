1. download FontForge 

https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/actions  
pick most recent green action in master branch.  
scroll to the bottom and choose the mingw64.  
open zip  
don't use the setup folder, instead look at the bottom for something like this:  
FontForge-mingw-w64-x86_64-c699b7-ci.7z  
this is the program without the inno-setup,  
copy anywhere...  

2. copy 'sfddiff.ff' anywhere.

3. run the following command, make sure to specify full-paths wrapped with "" when possible.

`call "C:\path\to\fontforge.bat" -lang "ff" -script "C:\other\path\to\sfddiff.ff"  "font1.ttf" "font2.otf"  1>"C:\another\path\to\report.txt"  2>&1`  

it will be very hard to read it from console,  
so the following command will 'dump' it into a text file.  

fix the paths above to your locations.
